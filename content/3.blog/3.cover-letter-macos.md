## The Job Application Struggle

We've all been there - applying for jobs can be an exhausting process. One of the most time-consuming aspects is crafting unique, personalized cover letters for each position. After spending countless hours writing cover letters, I decided to leverage technology to make this process more efficient.

::div{ .grid .grid-cols-3 .items-center .w-full .gap-x-8 }
  ![automation](https://picsum.photos/id/180/400/400){ width="400" height="400" .rounded-lg .col-span-1 }
  ::div{ .col-span-2 }
  ### The Solution: Apple Shortcuts
  I created an iOS/macOS shortcut that transforms the cover letter writing process into a simple, one-click operation. With minimal setup - just pasting your resume and ChatGPT API key once - you're ready to generate customized cover letters instantly.
