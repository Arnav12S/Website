## üåü The Challenge of Modern Job Search

Let's be real‚Äîfinding the right job, especially within European startups, can feel like navigating an endless maze. I've been there, watching my passive job search turn active, pouring hours into applications, and still feeling stuck in a cycle that leaves both me and potential employers with doubts.

## Why This Approach?

While passively job hunting, I noticed something striking about the traditional hiring process. Companies typically invest over 100 hours to hire the right person, even for entry-level roles. The average Time to Hire (TTH) stretches to 35-45 hours of active engagement, and for senior positions, it can extend to 60-90 days.

Think about all the time spent on:
- Multiple interview rounds
- Hypothetical case studies
- Lengthy assessment processes
- Coordinating with various stakeholders

Even after all this effort, both parties often remain uncertain about the fit. That's why I thought‚Äîwhy not channel this same time and energy into something more practical? Instead of solving hypothetical problems, why not work on actual challenges the company is facing?

## My Proactive Solution: The Trial Work Week

I'm offering a unique proposition: a one-week trial period where I can demonstrate my value while companies can evaluate my fit in real-time. This isn't just about showing skills; it's about creating tangible value while assessing mutual compatibility.

Instead of spending 35-45 hours on traditional hiring processes, let's invest that time in hands-on collaboration with measurable results.

- **Assess Fit:** Experience real work dynamics instead of relying solely on interviews.
