## Task Automation with Lutra

[Lutra](https://www.lutra.ai) has become my go-to tool for automating repetitive tasks. Its intuitive interface and powerful AI capabilities allow me to:

## The Power of Zapier and ChatGPT

The combination of [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) has enabled me to create powerful automation workflows. Here's a recent project I developed:

### LinkedIn Job Scraper with Google Apps Script

I created a tool to help recruiting companies streamline their job search process. Using Google Apps Script and AI, the tool:

```javascript
function scrapeLinkedInJob(url) {
// Fetch job posting content
const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
const content = response.getContentText();
// Extract relevant information using regex
const title = content.match(/job-title">(.?)<\/h1>/)[1];
const company = content.match(/company-name">(.?)<\/a>/)[1];
const location = content.match(/location">(.?)<\/span>/)[1];
// Add to spreadsheet
const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
sheet.appendRow([url, title, company, location, new Date()]);
}
```


This automation has helped recruiters save countless hours by automatically extracting and organizing job posting information into a structured format.

## Looking Ahead: The Future of AI Tools

As AI technology continues to evolve, I'm excited about the possibilities for even more powerful tools and automations. The key is finding the right balance between automation and human touch, ensuring that AI enhances rather than replaces human creativity and decision-making.
